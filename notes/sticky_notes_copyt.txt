MAKE PROPER CUSTOM COLOUR PALLETES
MAKE A FEW STAGES
making one array equal another may just pass a memory reference

idea - feints: being able to release a smash attack, then cancel it back into the charge within 2 frames at half power
 - different parts of the body have different hitboxes that change knockback, damage, and spin chance
 - dodge out of attacks for increased shield meter cost

-character creator
- mac down b chargeable helmet throw up. Huge spike infinite range
- scale knockback based on part of body hit

cool character idea
 - is able to record last inputs and replay them
 - could be used to make like a clone that constantly redoes a 3 second set of actions
 - could be used to double up on attacks
 - multihits
 - can use rewind for recovery
 - maybe heal percentage back?
 - ghosting effect?
 - horde type character

another cool character idea
-has some moves that are super fast, low knockback, combo extenders, but they heal the enemy
-has other moves that are very damaging, but hard to combo with
-has some moves which damage themself, but have very high hitstun on the enemy
-very fast character, heal when shielding
-low shield capacity, but faster recharge
-have vacuum type windbox special move, used to extend combos
-grabbing an enemy heals them significantly, but throws are extremely powerful
-throws have a run up before the actual throw, where the character runs wiht the grabbed guy
-shield meter takes half the damage the character receives while not empty
-shield meter run out makes them explode in a healing cloud for the enemy
